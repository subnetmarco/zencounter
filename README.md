# zencounter

Zencounter is a low latency, in-memory, eventual consistent, distributed counter server. You can increment/decrement counters atomically across multiple servers in a cluster. You can also create multiple counters for every stored object, and optionally set different expiration dates on them.

# Note

It's still in development. **Don't use it**.
